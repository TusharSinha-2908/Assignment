# Task :

Use the attached JSON file as your mock data as API response, parse this user data and display it in a list view, alongside his name there will be a button named sign-in!

Once the user taps on his name for the first time, he’ll be prompted a dialog where he needs to fill in his age and gender, once they have done so, it’ll take the user to the new screen where he’ll be displayed his name, age, gender!

Now, once this is done every individual user sign-in is retained in local storage, using DB of your preference like getting storage, hive… so now the sign-in button alongside the name changes to sign-out.

The next time, the user clicks over his name he is not shown the dialog, simply taken to the next screen, where his details name, age, and gender are shown.

On clicking sign-out, we remove the user sign-in state from the local DB, so the button toggles to sign in once again!
